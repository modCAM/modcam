 * Returns the positive remainder from the division of the first argument by the

 * Unlike the standard library modulus operator, this version of the modulus
 * operator allows us to loop backward through array indices. For example,
 * mod(-1, 3) == 2, whereas in the standard library -1 % 3 == -1.

 * @param b the divisor
 * @return the positive remainder r, such that r == a - x * b, where x is
